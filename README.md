## Hi! :smiley:
This weather app is my first contact whit API request and was made using HTML, SCCS and Vanilla JavaScript.

There is so many weather apps, but my app stands out with its minimalistic design and dark mode function made with local storage.

Used data:
* Weather API: (https://openweathermap.org/)
* Icons: (https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/)
